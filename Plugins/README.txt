This example needs the Quattro Wireless SDK (qwandroidsdk.jar) and the AdMob SDK (admob-sdk-android.jar), or the respective parts
need to be removed from build_plugin.sh / AdPluginActivity.java. It also needs a correct path to the classes.jar inside the
Unity Editor installation directory.

Everything is provided as an example, and needs further configuration before actual deployment is possible.
